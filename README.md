# A small template made to learn CRUD with THP !

This template contains a PostGreSQL database with only one table : gossips, with two attributes :
- title
- content

The gems are :
- table_print
- mini-racer

There is only one controller with BAD ROUTES (non-conventional) for example with the content of the course !
- gossips_controller.rb

You only have to :
- bundle install
- rails db:create
- rails db:migrate
- rails db:seed

And then you follow the steps ;)

# Enjoy !
